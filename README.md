# ROV-Controller-Android-to-PIC

An app that makes it possible to control an ROV (underwater Robot) via android 

===================================

**This project is work for Admiral Team (from Engineering Faculty, Suez canal university).**

**This project was made for MATE ROV competition.**

===================================

**This project consists of 3 stages :-**

   - Android controller.
   - PC Bridge.
   - PIC Microcontroller app.

**Work Flow :-**

Via any android phone you can control the robot via usb cable to PC or wifi/bluetooth network.

PC bridge handles the orders then send them to the PIC MCU via Ethernet using UDP.

In the PIC it recieves the order and behaves according to it.

PIC can send signals from sensors to PC Bridge.
